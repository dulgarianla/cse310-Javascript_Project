# Overview
Welcome to the overview of today's code and what the purpose of it. 

The software I wrote is a Tic-Tac-Toe program in TypeScript. This program allows two user aka the players to play a simple game of tic-tac-toe. It initializes the game board, allows players to take turns by clicking on boxes, checks for a win, and provides a way to reset the game. It also displays the winner and includes a "Play Again" button.

# Development Environment
Here are the tools that was use for my software and what each of them are and how they work.

### GitHub
>GitHub is a place where programmers store, share, and collaborate on their code, making it easier to work on big projects together and keep track of all the changes. It's like a big, organized playground for building digital stuff.

- Why I used it: to share my code and save it which helped keep track of my changes and show me when I did each change. It also allows me to share it so others like you can look at it.

### Visual Studio Code 
>Visual Studio Code is friendly, free, and smart computer program that makes writing and working with code easier, whether you're building websites, apps, games, or anything else that uses computer languages. It's like having a helpful assistant by your side as you explore the world of coding.

- Why I used it: I used this to create and run my software.

# Useful Websites
Down below are websites that I used to help learn and better my understanding of C++ and it might help you if you want to learn the language too

- [w3schools (Typescript Introduction)](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_intro.php)

- [typescriptlang](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

*Note: Youtube is also an amazing place to learn a programming language! I was able to find so many tutorials/crash course! I will provide links below*

# Future Work
Here is some things that I could have added or even improve to make the software more advance

**Error Handling:** Implement error handling to gracefully deal with unexpected user interactions or issues that might arise during gameplay. This can help prevent crashes or unexpected behavior.

**Security:** If my game involves user authentication, data storage, or other sensitive information, pay attention to security best practices to protect user data.

**Advanced Features** Expand the game's functionality by incorporating advanced features like: Single-player mode with computer AI (artificial intelligence).
